            <p>Hello! My name is Raihan Moosa. I am an aspiring technologist with a deep-rooted passion for Artificial 
                Intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge technology. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology 
                offers in transforming the world, and my curiosity has only grown as I’ve delved deeper into AI, machine learning, and computational 
                systems.
                Outside of academics, I spend a lot of time exploring the latest trends in AI, robotics, and quantum computing, staying up-to-date with 
                groundbreaking research and innovative startups that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. I’m an active contributor to online 
                tech communities and often participate in hackathons, where I collaborate with like-minded individuals to build prototypes that tackle 
                real-world challenges.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: blueviolet;">Latest Project: To - Do - List App</h3>
            <p> I created a simple To-Do List App where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The app allows users to mark tasks as completed and stores the data in the browser's local storage, so the list persists even after refreshing the page. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve my skills in front-end development and interactive web features. This project helped me learn how to manage user input and build a functional, user-friendly web application.

                This project is very straightforward and focuses on basic web development, making it perfect for showcasing your ability to build simple, interactive apps.</p>
