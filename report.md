In this assignment, I created a simple web page about myself and deployed it to GitHub Pages. The project involved initializing a Git repository, creating necessary files, managing branches, and making commits.

Steps Taken:

    Repository Initialization: I created a repository on GitHub and cloned it locally on my dekstop.

    File Creation: I added the required files: index.html (with my student ID), student-info.txt (containing my student ID and name), and report.md (this report).

    Branch Management: I created and worked on the feature/student-details branch, then merged it into the main branch.

    Commit and Deployment: I committed changes with meaningful messages and deployed the index.html file to GitHub Pages.

This assignment helped me practice Git workflows, branching, and web deployment.
